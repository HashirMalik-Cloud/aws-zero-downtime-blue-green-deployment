# aws-zero-downtime-blue-green-deployment
This project demonstrates how production-grade zero-downtime deployments are implemented on AWS using Blue-Green and Rolling Deployment strategies.  Instead of taking applications offline during updates, traffic is safely shifted between isolated environments — ensuring high availability, safe releases, and instant rollback.
